I decided to start writing a blog about my adventures in data science for a few reasons:
- I enjoy writing about what i'm working on
- Writing makes me understand the subject more. I often think I know a concept well, but writing about it makes me realize what I don't understand and forces me to learn it better.
- I'll probably forget what I did; this way i'll be able to look back easily.
- I'd like to become more involved with the data science community.

## Short Bio
- B.S in physics, PhD in physical oceanography
- Postdoctoral researcher
- Transitioning to a data science career 

## Long Bio

I have a B.S in physics and completed my PhD in physical oceanography at the University of Washington School of Oceanography and Applied Physics Laboratory in December 2014. My research focused on internal tides, near-inertial waves, and turbulent mixing. I used a combination of field observations from multiple platforms and computer models to study these processes. 

I’m currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Ocean Mixing Group at Oregon State University, working remotely from Golden, CO. My main focus has been on processing and analyzing ocean turbulence data collected from research ships with a new technique that is easier and cheaper than traditional measurements. I developed a a standardized data collection and processing framework (maintained in a github repository) to allow easier analysis and investigation, and provide shore-side support to researchers collecting data on the ship. I’ve also had the opportunity to work on several other projects, including the development of an autonomous, powered kayak to collect near-surface oceanographic data. 

I’ve always enjoyed the data science aspects of research, and am now looking to begin a career in that field. I believe my research experience has prepared me well with the skills and experience to succeed in data science. I have a passion for developing data processing and analysis that is transparent and reproducible. I like to develop ways to leverage the large amount of existing data into useful products and enabling others to make use of it. I have a strong background in data processing and quantitative analysis, as well as conveying that information in scientific papers. The combination of my science background and data analysis skills allows me to better understand the needs of data users and develop products and methods that are more useful.
