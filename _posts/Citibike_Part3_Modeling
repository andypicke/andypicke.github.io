In this third part of blog posts analyzing NYC Citibike data, i'll focus on modeling the daily number of rides taken, based on my previous [EDA]().

## First simple model

The first model i'll try is a simple linear regression. The predictors i'll use are:
* temperature
* wind speed
* cloud cover
* weekday
* Number of stations
* Holiday (binary yes/no)

This model is pretty good, with a R^2 of about 0.82.

## Random forest regressor

A random forest regression model performs better, with a R^2 of about 0.88 .

## Examining residuals

Examining the residuals in detail shows that some of the largest residuals occur on or near holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas.
