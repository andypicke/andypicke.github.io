Kate and I are planning to have our wedding in Colorado, so I thought i'd look at some historical weather data and try to figure out the best dates (weather-wise). Check out the results:

Of course, we are also learning that it will depend a lot on the limited availability of the venue! Apparently people start planning their weddings wayy in advance :) .
