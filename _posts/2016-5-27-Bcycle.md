title: Weather and Bikes
---

I recently attended "Transportation Camp" in Boulder. Motivated by that, I decided to analyze some data from Denver's Bcycle bike-rental program. Since I know that for me the weather is probably the biggest factor in whether I ride my bike, I wanted to see how much of an effect it had on Bcycle rides in Denver. You can check out my analysis here: <https://github.com/andypicke/Bcycle/blob/master/BcycleDenver.md>.
