title: Plotting Maps in R!
tags: R
---

I want to plot a simple map for a data analysis iâ€™m working on in R, and knew there must be a simple way to do that without having to get/plot shapefiles etc. (basically I just want a map of the US that I can add points to). A bit of googling found this excellent guide to doing just that! <http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/lectures/making-maps-with-R.html> . Thanks Eric C. Anderson.
