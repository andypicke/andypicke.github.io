# Some data science resources i've found helpful

During my journey into data science, i've searched for and tried many different online resources. The good news is that there are a ton of really great blogs, classes, tutorials, and examples available to learn data science. The bad news is that it can be very overwhelming trying to decide what to learn or focus on. Below are some of the resources i've used a lot and found useful.

## General

* [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Probably my most-used resource for answers to programming problems. I don't think i've ever actually gone to the website and searched; I usually just google the problem and stackoverflow answers almost always pop up first.

* <https://chrisalbon.com/> - Chris is a data scientist who has documented solutions to many common data science problems he's encountered (and you will probably encoutner) on his site, nicely organized by topic. Thanks Chris!


## Courses

* [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) - Online data science courses, mostly in R and python (but they are adding more like sql). I really like the course format; there are some short lecture videos, but you are also actually coding solutions in the interactive session. They have a lot of free tutorials, and subscriptions are $25/month for unlimited courses.

* Udemy - Some good data science courses on here. Most courses list the full price at $100-200, but they are always on sale (I don't think i've paid more than $15 for a course). I guess their sales strategy is to make you feel like you are getting a great deal?

* Coursera

* Udacity

* Edx

* Kaggle Learn
